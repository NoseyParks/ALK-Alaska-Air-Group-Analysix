#10001	3-Jan-25	FlyerTalk	PaceLaw2012	255,000	HELP: Someone hacked my AS account - 255K miles gone! Is AS under attack? Just checked my AS balance to see if my first flight of the year posted and I saw that someone booked a QR flight from PVG to JFK for 255k miles for someone. Activity page says Qatar Airways QR PVG-JFK DPVFER Yioing Wang Redeemed -255000. I am not Yioing Wang. I never received a confirmation email or otherwise would have stopped it immediately. I was also the subject of a spam bomb attack on my primary email 2 weeks ago but I managed to change all my email addresses. I also see this message when I go to my account main page: Mileage Program Discrepancies The Mileage Program account has some discrepancies. Contact Customer Care for assistance at 1-800-654-5669 Monday-Friday 7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. (PT) and Saturday 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (PT) Anyone else getting this? Currently on the phone with customer service. Hoping to get a resolution soon!	comment link	archive link
#10002	6-Jan-25	Reddit	ComplaintKooky7504	80,000	80000+ points transferred out of my Alaska account I just noticed that almost all my Alaska points were transferred out of my account the week of Christmas and it was not me. My primary contact email and phone number was changed on my account too and I never got a email or notification from Alaska that my primary contact information was changed. I am waiting for Alaskas customer support phone number to open and given them a call to figure out what the hell has happened. Obviously I got hacked but I am very surprised I received no notification or anything from Alaska when my primary contact information was changed. Has anyone ever experienced this?	comment link	archive link
#10003	6-Jan-25	Reddit	landonfox	800,000	They've been telling me its coming soon for years now. Pretty pathetic most local credit unions have it figured out but they can't. I also had my miles stolen over 800k of them actually. They reimbursed me but told me that was a one time thing and that I should put a pin in. Problem is I buy flights weekly and sometimes there is a 45+ minute wait on hold. And its not their 24/7 reservation team that can do it its the tech team that closes at night so lots a times I was stuck unable to buy flights at all when I wanted to. Ultimately I removed my pin and am just crossing my fingers until they can get MFA/2FA. Sure with the merger it will be even longer	comment link	archive link
#10004	6-Jan-25	Reddit	Past_Commission_3733		This happened to me a few months ago. They took all my points and the funds in my wallet. I contacted Alaska showed proof that the flights were for booked under someone else's name and Alaska re-instated my points/wallet after a few weeks. They froze my account and still I can't make any redemptions though. I need to follow up with Alaska about getting it unfrozen	comment link	archive link
#10005	7-Jan-25	Reddit	RareLime		Same situation for me as well. I found an award flight to Japan about a year into my account being locked and of course by the time customer service opened the award was gone. They let me remove the PIN step but I had to verbally acknowledge if my account was hacked again I wouldn't be able to recover the stolen miles. I will say the person I was working with was deeply apologetic about the process and rules and helped me file a complaint about it.	comment link	archive link
#10006	16-Jan-25	US Card Forum	Hourglass 9		I just received an email from Alaska Revenue Protection saying my account was suspicious and I needed to call their customer service. At first I thought it was a phishing email but after checking the phone number I found it was legitimate. Then I logged into my account and saw my points were down to a few hundred a bunch of tickets had been swapped out and my email and phone number had been changed. I waited half an hour for customer service and they said there have been many cases recently including travel agencies of fraudulently using other people's accounts. They told me to upload my ID and set a four-digit password and that I would have to call to unlock it before each use. They also said that if I was fraudulently used again after that they wouldn't provide compensation. :cry: Are there any security breaches lately? I've always used Google Password Manager and I don't think I've ever manually entered my password.	comment link	archive link
#10007	23-Jan-25	TrustPilot	Maeve		I recently discovered that my Alaska Airlines mileage account was accessed without authorization and my miles were used to book flights under unknown names. While my miles were eventually restored and my account was locked the process was frustratingly slow and their communication was severely lacking. Customer Care admitted they were aware of this ongoing security issue yet there was no urgency in addressing it. When I repeatedly asked when security improvements would be implemented they avoided the question provided no timeline for changes. It’s unacceptable for a major airline to downplay a security breach affecting customer accounts. Alaska Airlines must take immediate action notify affected customers proactively and prioritize stronger security measures before more travelers fall victim to this issue.	comment link	archive link
#10008	28-Jan-25	FlyerTalk	worldwidedreamer		As an additional data point someone hacked into the MileagePlan account of my wife and also redeemed points for Qatar Airways flights. What's strange is that of all Alaska partners it seems like there is a coherence of fraudulent awards booked on QR. Weird huh?	comment link	archive link
#10009	28-Jan-25	US Card Forum	meteorsin	500,000	My email account was hacked. Following the instructions in the forum I checked my balance from highest to lowest and sure enough it had been stolen. Minus 500000. I think so. I checked my HA account and there were no related records. The customer service line has a two-hour wait	comment link	archive link
#10010	29-Jan-25	Twitter	adamstatonsmith		AlaskaAir My account was hacked—miles stolen name changed email changed phone number changed and password changed. And now you're telling me that if this happens again you won’t refund the miles because you're 'not sure where the responsibility lies?!' 2 hours on the phone and 7 emails later its finally fixed but 'sorry we cant distribute any apology miles because we're not sure it was us.'	comment link	archive link
#10011	1-Feb-25	Reddit	digitalkyle		Yup. Happened to my wife’s account. Using miles is now a pain. I don’t understand why they don’t implement some sort of 2fa. This is standard security across most sites these days. We got all the miles back and were told ‘if we find out this was you. We will peruse prosecution’. Anyhow miles back with having to unlock before using.	comment link	archive link
#10012	1-Feb-25	Reddit	idkdc1031		Alaska account Hacked :( And they are using my miles. Tried calling their phone number (2+ hours wait) and text message (do not support account issues). Anyone experienced this and what to expect. Does Alaska undo transactions and redeposit miles.	comment link	archive link
#10013	1-Feb-25	Reddit	no_mames_wey123		This happened to me about 6 months ago. They cancelled the fraud transactions and refunded the amount. I also requested a new mileage number and they provided me with a new account. One annoying thing was that every time I use the account from then on (any miles related purchase) I have to call them a provide a code to unlock the account. Otherwise they will not refund any future fraud transactions.	comment link	archive link
#10014	1-Feb-25	Reddit	FlashyOutlandishness		Just went through this a few weeks ago as well and had the same experience.	comment link	archive link

#10016	4-Feb-25	US Card Forum	MegaBrother		I received a Chase transaction notification right after the Chinese New Year. Upon checking I saw my Alaska Airlines account had been used for a zero-dollar purchase. The name seemed to be Indian and the flight was from Dubai to Sri Lanka. The strangest thing is that it used my expired credit card but it still charged the new card even though it was expired.	comment link	archive link
#10017	5-Feb-25	FlyerTalk	AKLifetimeFlyer		This just happened to my friend today. The hacker redeemed (or brokered) a CX award redemption (originating in India) with his MP account and spambombed his email to try to hide it. Thankfully AS reinstated all of his miles when he called customer care even though the first leg of the trip was already completed. This friend of mine is no slouch a techie for sure so it can happen to anyone. AS locked his account and gave him a pin to reference. AS also indicated they will be introducing 2FA soon. stay vigilant out there.	comment link	archive link
#10018	10-Feb-25	Twitter	jdwrenn		Were Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan accounts compromised? Is anyone else missing a whole bunch of miles?	comment link	archive link
#10019	11-Feb-25	Twitter	NezhatNico		AlaskaAir’s policy for verifying my account that was hacked (someone booked multiple flights using my miles) is for me to reply to a customer support email with a phone of my drivers license. No secure link or encrypted file share service. Or I can fax a copy…	comment link	archive link
#10020	13-Feb-25	Twitter	mauwow		AlaskaAir is anyone working at your contact center? I’ve been on hold for 1hr and 45 min+ after placing a call and requesting an auto call back. My mileage account was hacked and would like to speak with someone.	comment link	archive link

#10022	20-Feb-25	Reddit	crazycouponman	70,000	Another hack story. They need 2fa immediately. Customer service is the worst. So I've heard and read of several people's Mileage Plans accounts being hacked recently with the fraudsters being able to make huge miles purchases - This happened to me last month. I discovered this because a charge appeared on my Alaska card for $5.60 (usually the taxes you pay for a ticket booked with miles). Someone had managed to fraudulently make a booking worth 70k miles - the scary part is I received no email no text no push at all. The hacker had not even changed the email address on my account Alaska simply does not send the right security notifications out to the email/phone on file if you've made the booking with a different email address (ofc the fraudsters know this). Alaska customer care reinstated the miles and locked my account with a pin - They told me I need to call back every time I need to make a booking with my account locked. Tried to call Alaska (in the pm) for a booking yesterday I had to wait on the phone for 2.5 hours (no option for a call back). Spoke to three of the rudest CS reps I've ever spoken to in my life (they all seem to think they are better than you) they unlocked the account for an hour during which I had to scramble to make my booking. The second time I had to call them (in the am) also waited 30 minutes on the phone. Calling to have to make a booking is not a reasonable option. They also said if I unlock my account permanently and fraud happens again they will not reinstate the miles again. Rather then providing the right online security measure with 2FA they would prefer to threaten and inconvenience their. End of my rant - I used to think Alaska was one of the best airlines but it has quickly shot down to the bottom. Hope this helps someone - I did not realize miles would be so easily hacked in 2025 keep an eye out and change your passwords regularly. Feel free to post your Alaska hacked rant below and to put some kind of pressure on them not that they care at all	comment link	archive link
#10025	20-Feb-25	Reddit	Zakarumae		Happened to me yesterday but they changed my email to a new domain but kept the beginning the same. Weirdly they booked me a flight along with the scammers. Only caught it because like above I get texts every time I have a charge on my card and they used my Alaska card along with the miles. Along with 2FA I'd love a secure site to upload the government ID to as well instead of sending it in an email. The other surprise was them signing my real email up for a shitload of spam emails to flood my inbox but why I don't know. I never even got an email about the miles being used or the flight booked notification since they changed the email address.	comment link	archive link
#10026	20-Feb-25	Reddit	No-Fig-8614		I got hacked luckily they cuaght it and froze my account and gave me back my miles but had to go to my CC company to get the refund on the on file. How DO THEY NOT HAVE 2FA?!	comment link	archive link
#10027	21-Feb-25	Reddit	Eggtalonn		I was hacked two months ago and I’m still waiting for my wallet funds to be returned.	comment link	archive link
#10028	21-Feb-25	US Card Forum	ghtjyjy	600,000	This is the first time I've been hacked. It involved Alaska miles they bought three tickets—two in Indian names plus my own—on Qatar Airways from TRV in India to Doha (DOH) and then to Toronto (YYZ) with each ticket costing 200000 miles. My points were immediately refunded after the call. I saw that others who had been flying for a long time also got their points back after the call which is great about Alaska. The only downside is that the account gets locked and I have to call to temporarily unlock PIN each time I want to redeem.	comment link	archive link
#10029	22-Feb-25	Reddit	MrGutterballs	85,000	Same exact thing happened to me. 85k to reserve a hotel in Spain. Took a bunch of work to get it reinstated too. And then the PIN garbage.	comment link	archive link
#10030	3-Mar-25	Facebook	SPH		I just randomly opened my Alaska Airline account and realized that someone named Andre Benson got himself two business class tickets with my mileage. He reserved yesterday and he is flying right now on a second flight. Trying to get help to catch him but what do I do?	comment link	archive link
#10031	3-Mar-25	Facebook	BRC		Someone hacked into my credit card account and wiped out all my points last year. I got them all back but I did not know this was a thing until then. Reading these comments seems like it might be common…yeesh!!	comment link	archive link
#10032	3-Mar-25	Facebook	BA		It happened to me before but I noticed it the day before they were supposed to fly out so it got canceled. I'd call the airline asap.	comment link	archive link
#10033	3-Mar-25	Facebook	EC		Happened to me a few weeks ago. Alaska locked down my account immediately placed a flag on the person’s flights and refunded my points after I sent over a copy of my license. Took about 45 minutes for the entire process.	comment link	archive link
#10034	3-Mar-25	Facebook	EN		Omg it happened to me too last year. But i was able to cancel the flights before he took em. And got my miles back. Smh scammers. Gluck	comment link	archive link
#10035	3-Mar-25	Facebook	LB	500,000	our Alaska Airlines account was hacked as well 500000 miles for a hotel in Canada. We did not have to make a police report and they refunded our miles after they did their investigation. I don’t know if their policy has changed.	comment link	archive link
#10036	3-Mar-25	Facebook	VC	80,000	That’s so strange I logged in to check my balance after reading this and am missing almost 80K miles with no redemption and activity. to update they say someone issued a BA ticket on my account clearly not me. Someone from Ghana flew and Alaska doesn’t even e mail when a ticket is redeemed - what a massive idiocracy. Please check your accounts I checked mine for missing miles- reached out to Alaska and turns out some Richard travelled on my Alaska points on BA in September on Business Class.	comment link	archive link
#10037	3-Mar-25	Facebook	GH		Unfortunately happened to me too. First call Alaska and start a case. They were able to refund all my points but I have a permanent lock on account which I can only temporarily unfreeze with a pin given to agent verbally. Unsure why they don’t have 2 factor still lol Also probably a good reminder to stop recycling the same password and use some type of password service like Bitwarden. if they got into one account with their password I’m sure they’re trying to get into tons of others	comment link	archive link
#10038	5-Mar-25	US Card Forum	wsyzxlz		My account was hacked without any notification. I only discovered my points had been stolen when I logged in and by then the flight had already taken off. Did you get your points back in the end?	comment link	archive link
#10039	6-Mar-25	Facebook	JK		This happened to me before I even received the card in the mail or created an account. Not sure what’s going on with Alaska.	comment link	archive link
#10040	6-Mar-25	Facebook	MD	100,000	DP: Not sure if this has been posted before. Apologies if redundant. My Alaska acct was hacked and they charged $300 in flights and took 100000pts. Everything was recovered but now I have to have a PIN number and call in to Alaska customer care if I want to use my miles. This has to be done during business hours and they are not open Sundays. They offered to not have the PIN etc but then said if miles were stolen again they would not replace. I waited 20m on hold to speak with customer care so I assume that’s probably going to be average just to tell them I want to book an awards flight in the future. 1. The flights that were booked with the points had not happened so the points weren’t spent. 2. Authenticator app 2 factor text or emails are apparently not an option  3. Maybe this is a post for travel grumps but I just built up a bunch of Alaska miles and now this little wrinkle is going to be an unnecessary headache. 4. I am grateful to get the miles back but I won’t be snapping up any hard to get seats without a massive hold time to customer care that occurs sometime bt 9a-6p Monday - Saturday . Rant over.  Anyone else had this happen?	comment link	archive link
#10041	16-Mar-25	US Card Forum	DaDouDou		Update: The Mileage department was closed on Sunday so I called to make the reservation and left a callback. I received a callback two hours later. I explained the situation and customer service said they would check with their staff to see which transactions were fraudulent. They said they would send me an email within 24 hours asking for my driver's license to prove my identity and then they would send me a PIN. They said I would need to call and use this PIN to unlock my account before making any future redemptions. we will redeposit your points to your account after the verification. Just found out I've been infected. I searched through the barrage of emails from the past few days looking at various hotel companies and their points/reservations but I didn't find any suspicious emails so I ignored them. Then I just saw the credit card notification and realized that someone had charged me 5.6% in taxes and that's when I realized I had really been scammed. I was surprised to see that it was an Alaska flight and then I realized that someone had already redeemed a business class ticket for YYZ - DOH - TFU (this is amazing you can't cancel on Alaska and you can't even see the Qatar Airways schedule or reservation number). I can see the contact emails casaplanyacht.ocn.ne.jp but they seem to be fake. Why didn't I receive an email notification about the points redemption? Chat support said they didn't have the authority and told me to call back on Monday. I'll talk to them on Monday. There was also a BOS - SEA redemption that happened this afternoon which was Alaska's own service but I canceled it. Judging from their names they all seem to be Chinese. I'm wondering if I should send them an email telling them to stop buying tickets from ticket agents. Please be careful with your security. Don't use simple passwords for your Alaska account (mine was indeed very simple and it had been compromised before it was found through a credential stuffing attack using your email address and password).	comment link	archive link
#10042	16-Mar-25	US Card Forum	Spacetime		Me too. It's so troublesome. I can't redeem it outside of working hours. During working hours I have to wait in line for half an hour for customer service and then it only unlocks for one hour.	comment link	archive link
#10043	16-Mar-25	US Card Forum	YanamiAnna		Without OTP IT is truly terrible. Alaska even created a separate email service. Once your account is hacked you can only lock your customer service PIN which means you'll miss out on mileage tickets and your account is essentially useless.	comment link	archive link
#10044	16-Mar-25	US Card Forum	Fly Away		Hopefully I can get my mileage back from hitting the teacher tomorrow. I was so scared that I quickly changed my password to a string of random characters longer than 20.	comment link	archive link
#10045	16-Mar-25	US Card Forum	Irish Coffee		I was indeed too lazy. I thought that since there would be an email notification the credit society could just dispute it immediately. Unexpectedly there was no email notification.	comment link	archive link
#10046	16-Mar-25	US Card Forum	lsroyce		Last month my account was also hacked. They used it to book an Alaska Vacations trip in Brazil through Expedia but deducting Alaska points. I received an email and contacted Alaska immediately but they said the trip was non-refundable and I had to call the hotel to cancel. I told them that since it was fraudulently used I couldn't cancel directly and they said yes I had to contact the hotel (scumbag Alaska). Then a while later they told me the hotel staff handling this had gone off duty and I had to contact them again tomorrow (seriously I want to curse Alaska). Unexpectedly Expedia called three times (I missed the first two) asking if I had booked the trip. I said no it was fraudulently used and Expedia canceled it for me and my points were immediately refunded.	comment link	archive link
#10047	18-Mar-25	US Card Forum	nate1874		Just now during my routine check of all accounts I discovered that 150000 RMB had been stolen from account AS and five tickets from Hawaii to Seattle for tomorrow had been purchased. I immediately changed the password and canceled the tickets.	comment link	archive link
#10048	30-Mar-25	US Card Forum	harryiori		My Alaska Airlines account was hacked before. I called customer service and they refunded my deposit. Then they asked me to send the front and back of my ID and a setup PIN. They said if I didn't get the setup PIN they wouldn't refund my deposit next time. The key issue is that after getting the setup PIN award tickets can only be issued by phone and not 24/7. Alaska Airlines Customer Care Phone: 1-800-654-5669 7:00 am - 7:00 pm (PT) Monday-Friday 8:00 am - 5:00 pm (PT) Saturdays This is basically a total rip-off. It's clearly their problem that the account was hacked so why should the consumer have to pay for it? I'm absolutely furious! Is there any way to get revenge?	comment link	archive link
#10049	22-Apr-25	FlyerTalk	Cupajoe	210,000	I discovered when looking at my Milage Activity on April 12th my account had been breeched. Six passengers four being children (the oldest child being 10 and two infants). The flight was from Quebec I believe to Dubai on Qatar. My activity shows six awards withdrawn on March 3rd and redeemed and flew March 5th. The award redemption is inside the required 72 hours allowed by AS which would make it impossible to issue but whatever. Partner airlines prob. have diff. requirements. I did not receive any email or phone call from AS of suspicious activity at the time of the withdrawal. Each one way award Was 35K miles x 6 passengers = 210000 miles. On my activity I can see the name of the passengers. I called over the weekend April 12th to AS CS which was closed as it was after 7 pm pacific time. The rep. was kind and compassionate and while not able to remedy situation she spoke of similar methods to be made whole on miles stolen. She forwarded the info to I think the fraud dept. and she told me to write an email with the data I knew. I wrote that on Sunday so I suspect I should reach out to my MVP gold milage rep. The rep explained that the magnitude of AS site evolving has left exposure to many. AS is always kind to me so I feel confident that all will be fine. Wish there wasn't PIN restrictions put on all of us who have been breeched but out of my control. I keep a fairly extensive password management and obfiscation but they got in regardless. More creepy is they listed my daughters name who has her own CC and MP as the intitator of the transaction. And then put a completely random address for her in Juneau AK. Who knows the hackers seem to be always ahead of the institution holding the data. Hopefully it will all get sorted out. *Further research indicates credit card charges ($94.76/passenger) not refunded - told to contact bank.*	comment link	archive link
#10050	24-Apr-25	LinkedIn	ER		Mileage Plan hacking I discovered last month that my Mileage plan account had been hacked in December. Guy stole my points and bought tickets with it. I hadn't noticed until March because I hadnt flown Alaska in that time frame. I did all the things and had my miles restored and dutifully changed all passwords. I purchased some tickets a few weeks ago. Today I tried to check my account to verify something and once again can't access my account and get a we don't have any account linked to this email response when I try the Forgot Password option. This is exactly what happened last time so Im assuming I was hacked again. 2 questions: 1. Considering I did all the security things right and I haven't had any problems with any other accounts does this seem like the breach is more likely coming from their end? I find it hard to believe that someone who has access to my accounts is choosing to only steal my Alaska miles. 2. How does this scam work? You need to present ID to fly- how do they not catch these people after the fact? It's not like there's a secondary market they can sell tickets to. Obviously I'm missing something here would appreciate if someone can enlighten me.	comment link	archive link

#10053	14-May-25	Reddit	mutt82588	250,000	This just happened to me. Someone got in my account changed the recovery email and phone number and booked a ticket on qatar airlines JFK to hong kong for 250k miles. Must have got a sick seat. Did not get notified by AS that things were changed. I had not changed that password in many years so probably found in data breach. Alternatively I'm wondering if some one had spoofed the link for to transfer hawaiian and alaska miles and i accidentally entered it there. At any rate only found out when I could not log in to my acct. Called to day and AS was very helpful froze everything and told me that the flight hasnt flown yet so they are going to claw my miles back. The CSR said that unfortunately she has to do this 3-5 times per day and if the flight has already flown then miles are gone. I asked if I should report to authorties adn she told me not to even bother. On my milage history it had the passengers name and the qatar confirmation number. I tried to look up the reservation on qatars website but the itenerary was already cancelled. My question is why doesn't the airline go after these folks? Seems like this is a rare category of internet fraud where the fraudster or associate has to use a real identity and has physically show up somewhere. They come to you in a heavily policed secured area! If the airline didnt cancel the ticket flagged it internally and then just had it error at boarding with an airport cop right there boom. What am I missing here?	comment link	archive link
#10054	3-Jun-25	OneMileAtATime	RobASFO	170,000	Ben I too had miles stolen from my Alaska account for a Qatar business ticket Montreal issued to a woman in Lagos Nigeria. I too tracked her down on social media called Alaska to give her name and stated that these were stolen from my account. Alaska reinstated the 170000 miles to my account and I now have a PIN number to access the account  just like Ford Although this was caught two days before the actual flight and I would suspect that Alaska nullified the ticket I asked Alaska how they could issue a ticket under a different name and gender with my frequent flyer miles but did not get a satisfactory answer. In fact I didn't even get an official acknowledgement in the form of a letter or email let alone an apology. It's strange but I doubt companies go after these individual scammers as it is too hard to prosecute unless it's done on a Federal level. A lot of the identity theft stems from these criminal gangs in places like Nigeria and Russia.	comment link	archive link
#10055	3-Jun-25	OneMileAtATime	Nedskids		I had a similar thing happen with Alaska a few months ago and have the same PIN/call/unlock thing. Which is only annoying when you're trying to get a mileage ticket in a hurry on a weekend when another airline has gone IROP... I had to resort to flying Southwest cross country this weekend.	comment link	archive link
#10056	3-Jun-25	OneMileAtATime	sowestcoast	59,000	This happened to me. Two different individuals redeemed my Alaska miles on two American Airlines flights totaling 59000 miles. I googled their names and found their FB profiles (also seemingly Nigerian?) and was tempted to confront them as well. Seems like there is some loophole that folks have found with redeeming partner awards? I now have to call Alaska to unlock my account each time I want to redeem a flight with miles.	comment link	archive link
#10057	3-Jun-25	US Card Forum	Aubonpain	215,000	This morning I discovered I couldn't log into the app which seemed wrong. I reset my password and found that neither my email address nor my phone number was recognized so I immediately called. After waiting 35 minutes I was finally able to speak with the agent. The perpetrator purchased the ticket in May a Qatar Airways business class flight from JFK to BKK using 215k points. The ticket has already been issued and the flight completed. The passenger's name is Lin Mei.	comment link	archive link
#10058	4-Jun-25	US Card Forum	chowchan		My AS account was also hacked and tickets were sold to an American in Austin. I didn't find out until several months later. I called customer service to get my points back and the account locked. Miles can be used to log in but to log out I have to call to unlock it which takes two hours. I think it's a bit troublesome but it's safer this way. I didn't receive an email about the ticket issuance and my email address wasn't updated after logging into my account. It's possible the email address was changed back after the ticket was issued.	comment link	archive link
#10059	4-Jun-25	US Card Forum	tlitb		My AS was stolen a while ago and it's gone. I contacted customer service and they sent me my ID. They said they would reinstate my miles within 15 business days and also asked me to set a PIN saying that I would need to call every time I used the miles. They said that's ridiculous.	comment link	archive link
#10060	16-Jun-25	Reddit	ElonFanboisSuck		I was hacked last week though partially it’s my fault. The password was involved in a data breach a while back and I forgot to reset this one. My bad on that. Sometimes you get lazy using a password manager and never paying attention to what the password actually is… However I don’t understand how any modern web service does not require two factor authentication before changing critical information like password email and phone number. Like it’s truly unacceptable at this point for any website especially one as important as air travel.	comment link	archive link
#10061	16-Jun-25	Reddit	pdxcouplese		I think I’m done with Alaska. A few months ago I noticed new emails and phone numbers on my profile and an international award travel ticket. I called Alaska and the award travel hadn’t happened yet so they could reverse it without issue. I updated my password to a long and difficult password. This morning I was sitting in a meeting and all of a sudden two emails pop up saying I canceled two upcoming flights booked with reward travel again. I immediately changed my password again. My account has the feature where I have to call to unlock for reward travel after the last hack so they were unable to book. Alaska won’t undo the cancellations. Frankly they won’t do anything. Their app is insecure and if something happens they refuse to help. Now I’m on hold waiting to get my account unlocked so I can rebook. The first flight costs more now. I’m shocked at how little they can do and how much no one wants to help. I expected a lot more. Delta anyone? They said both times it came from the app. My phone was sitting next to me when this happened.	comment link	archive link
#10062	17-Jun-25	OneMileAtATime	MelissaGuest	100,000	It looks like I am in good company. I just tried logging into my Alaska Air account and my password would not work. I then sent in a request to reset my password and I was asked whether I would prefer instructions go to my email address or my phone number (neither of which were actually MINE someone had hacked and changed them!). I called customer service (which took an hour to get through) and after several hours I was able to get everything restored. Someone had cashed in 100K worth of miles!	comment link	archive link
#10064	17-Jun-25	Reddit	Intelligent-Bat-1521	80,000	Had my Alaska miles stolen in June 2025. But I don't use AwardWallet. Also have unique passwords for each of my accounts. So is a Alaska Airlines breach. Someone transferred 80k miles to Qatar Airlines in the name of Ling Ms Yi. Still trying to get my miles back with Alaska Airlines. They still haven't sent me info on PIN etc. Really wish Alaska Airlines would go to 2F or multi-factor authentication too. Also wish for those accounts affected we were given extra miles & not penalized by having to call in with a PIN in order up use or transfer miles. Hope they have a special call center setup.	comment link	archive link

#10072	2-Jul-25	Reddit	pointstopointb	500,000	AwardWallet Saved Me From Having 500K+ Alaska Miles Stolen I got an odd notification from AwardWallet just now that my Alaska Airlines mile balance had gone down by over half a million miles. I found out that someone had hacked my account and booked two business class one-way tickets that were leaving within eight hours from the US to Doha to China. Fortunately AW gave me the confirmation numbers and I was able to cancel the tickets and reclaim my miles. I also was able to change my password. I'm on the phone right now with Alaska and on line to Qatar to report these thieves and give them information. My guess is that my information has been compromised for a while (last changed password in 2024) but because I had recently moved Amex -> Hawaiian -> Alaska my account became useful for them. Heads up to change your passwords.	comment link	archive link

#10076	3-Jul-25	Frequent Miler	Amol	500,000	Check your Alaska Airlines account security — I almost had over 500000 miles stolen today! Today I got an AwardWallet notification that my balance went down by over 500000 miles and that there was an upcoming reservation on it. Someone had taken my miles and booked two people a last minute business class award on Qatar from the USA to Doha to China. Luckily I had about 7 hours before check-in so I immediately called Alaska Airlines but there was a 1-hour wait. I was able to log on to my Alaska account and cancel the tickets and get my miles back then change my password. I finally got a call back from Alaska 2 hours later and reported the reservation details. My guess is that someone has had my account information for a while but in the past 2 weeks I have transferred Amex to Hawaiian and pooled all my family’s Hawaiian/Alaska miles into my account — with the inflated balance my account was now able to book multiple partner international business standard level mileage awards. I didn’t get a single notification from Alaska – not an email app notification or 2FA (which they don’t have). I urge everyone to check your Alaska password security and consider changing it particularly if you have a large inflated balance.	comment link	archive link
#10077	3-Jul-25	Frequent Miler	Stephen Pepper	85,000	I’d encountered this same issue myself although my experience was just over a year ago. I’d gone to book a couple of business class tickets from the US to the UK in May only to find my account with a very low balance. At first I was kicking myself thinking I’d let my miles expire. However when checking the activity on my account I noticed that there were three Mileage Plan Hotels redemptions all on the same day in February. Based on other reports from people whose accounts were hacked the redemptions that take place are last minute bookings usually for premium cabin flights. The reasoning for that is that it gives less time for the legitimate account holder to notice the missing miles and have those reservations cancelled. On my account rather than booking premium award flights someone made several hotel bookings presumably last minute for Valentine’s Day. I didn’t notice these redemptions until a few months later so it was too late for me to cancel those redemptions. I reached out to Mileage Plan to report that my account had been compromised and that someone had redeemed the majority of my miles. They offered to reinstate my miles provided I could provide a copy of my driver’s license or passport showing my legal name along with a four digit PIN to secure my account in the future. Those documents could be mailed faxed or emailed so I emailed them over to speed up the reinstatement of my miles. In the meantime I changed the password on my account. It took a full week but Alaska did eventually reinstate all my missing miles which I appreciated.	comment link	archive link
#10075	3-Jul-25	Reddit	rhefter		Same thing happened to me. I now have a block on my account for any award bookings. I have to call in to get it unblocked. The reps will stay on the phone while you are booking and then lock it back up right away after you get the confirmation. It's honestly not that bad and considering they do not have 2FA I'd rather the block be on my account.	comment link	archive link
#10080	4-Jul-25	Facebook	AR		Same thing happened to me. They cancelled the fraudulent flights and my legitimate flights. It was a mess! Now I have to call Alaska directly to book any award flights.	comment link	archive link
#10085	9-Jul-25	FlyerTalk	rny321	500,000	Someone booked two close in tickets to Japan with my Alaska Airlines miles. Alaska Airlines allowed someone to enter new names and send the only confirmation to an Email address of their choosing. I never received an Email text or phone call from Alaska Airlines about more than 500K in miles being used. If it wasn't for the coverup I would not have known about the fraudulent bookings until long after the flights were taken. When I woke up to roughly two thousand SPAM emails from a small number of addresses I guessed that the attack was designed to cover up something. Since I use multiple email addresses it didn't take long to guess that it was an airline. Alaska Airlines was my first choice. I was able to cancel the tickets and change the confirmation Email address to one of mine. I use a unique password for Alaska Airlines and my Hawaiian Airlines password does not resemble my Alaska Airlines password.	comment link	archive link

#10090	11-Jul-25	Frequent Miler	Pippa	85,000	Yikes! I also just found out that I had 85000 miles stolen transferred by a Ying Ms Li to Qatar Airlines on June 17. I was only just made aware of this. I keep trying to change my password on Alaska Air app & website but the only way to change password is to log out & select forgot password. But when I do this I get a system error. Alaska Air says they can reinstate my miles but I have to agree to email my ID create a PIN (still don’t know how to do this) & going forward only use their phone line to ever use the miles or transfer the miles. Their phone lines have massive wait times! Hours! If I ever find a mileage deal it will surely be gone before I can get ahold of someone on the phone. Alaska Air offered no apology. No accountability for this breach. Will FTC do anything? Why doesn’t Alaska Air have 2 factor authentication? How long has Alaska Air known about this? Why is Alaska Air putting blame & weight of this on their customers? (I don’t reuse passwords nor share my info) Would love some help & accountability.	comment link	archive link

#10099	13-Jul-25	Facebook	LA		This happened to my FIL about a month ago. Only caught it because I was helping them book an award flight. Alaska said there’s some scam where they take peoples money to book them a flight they use some random unsuspecting person’s miles to actually provide the ticket and pocket the cash. Wish they would add 2FA to their loyalty accounts instead of this pin and rep booking requirement.	comment link	archive link
#10100	19-Jul-25	Facebook	WB		Keep an eye on your Alaskan accounts. Mine was hacked. Spoke to the rep today and she said they had a huge influx since the Hawaiian miles transfers started especially since the end of June. Someone booked Doha to Toronto Qatar Business class with mine. I missed it by 12 hours he flew yesterday so I couldn't even get any joy out of stranding him at the airport. Also they said they will only return points for fraud once. If it happens again they may not.	comment link	archive link
#10109	19-Jul-25	Facebook	VB		This just happened to me a few weeks ago. I contacted Alaska customer service had to verify my identity and they immediately put the miles back in my account. I only noticed because I was booking a flight and a weird email populated for the confirmation. That triggered me to look at my miles then booked flights and someone had booked a flight from LAX to ATL. The name was in the booking. It was a washed up has been rapper lol.

#10101	19-Jul-25	Reddit	goa_to_rio		Sorry to hear about that. Stressful garbage for no reason if you ask me. Happened to me 2 months ago.

Sucks.	comment link	archive link
#10102	19-Jul-25	Reddit	jbuzolich	200,000	Yep same with me over 200k miles lost about a year ago. Alaska later restored which I'm thankful for but now I have the pin. We just returned from family trip to Hawaii. The prices were low and I would have preferred to use our existing companion voucher first and then maybe miles on the other ticket. My wife insisted we burn down the miles instead since there's no faith anymore they will still be available next time. They really need to up their email communication and add 2fa at minimum. A big part of what upset me besides the lost miles is that the flights the awards were used on were not in my family name of course and not between cities or countries I have ever been to. It should have easily been flagged as unusual.	comment link	archive link
#10103	19-Jul-25	Reddit	lisariley2	300,000	I had 300k miles stolen and Alaska gave them back to me and I now have a PIN number. But I'm ok with that as I don't want anyone to steal my miles.

#10104	19-Jul-25	Reddit	meowsabbers	250,000	Just noticed I had 250000 miles fraudulently redeemed from my Mileage Account Like many of you I transferred American Express points to Hawaiian Airlines and then to Alaska Airlines just days before the transfer partnership expired. In my case I transferred 270000 American Express points. Since then I hadn't really had a need to log in to my Alaska account. I happened to be searching for some flights today and noticed I had about 30000 miles in my account. I thought that was odd and then looked on Hawaiian Airlines. Sure enough my transferred miles were not there either. I then checked my mileage activity on Alaska and saw that on July 4th 250000 miles were redeemed for a flight from HNL to JFK. I live in LA and the name attached to the reservation was definitely nobody that I know. I spoke to Alaska and they confirmed that they flight was in fact flown but did clear this up quickly and reimbursed my account with the 250000 miles but I was a little taken aback by the way they were basically saying this is my fault and not theirs. It's a little crazy someone can redeem any amount of miles and the account holder is not notified. They said this reimbursement would be a one time courtesy and that if I don't add a PIN to my account as an additional layer of security they would not be reimbursing me if it were to happen again. I of course opted for the PIN but the downside is if I want to book reward travel I can no longer do it online or on the app I would have to call and book. Got the miles back quickly but I nearly lost my stomach for a minute there. Stay vigilant!	comment link	archive link

#10108	19-Jul-25	Reddit	MozzarellaBowl	220,000	Same here. 220k miles from Saudi Arabia. Extremely frustrating and stupid of them. Why wouldn’t I at the very least get an email notification about this? Apparently what they typically do is steal it as a travel agency do the person using it paid them a third party and has no idea it’s even illegitimate (apparently) and makes it harder to find the actual criminal.

#10113	22-Jul-25	Reddit	EarthBanger		Completely agree. Last year Alaska called me to inform me someone used my miles to fly Goa to Doha to Dulles on Emirates in First Class. The flight had already landed in DC and the person was gone. They booked their ticket 90min before its departure. Absolutely crazy there are no secondary checks especially for tickets being booked so close to departure or from a place or with a person that’s nowhere on your account. I now too have to call the reservations line anytime I want to use my miles for booking. Super fun since the reservations line has banker hours and no weekends. Extra super double fun when you do your research for reward flights make the call to reservations to have them released for a period of time and then find out those flights are just phantom inventory… Stay safe out there	comment link	archive link

What are you doing with your email account to make it untrustworthy?

I thought it was just my flights being canceled — and [the agent] was like yeah your miles are all gone. According to Horgan someone gained access to her account canceled her booked flights then used her accumulated miles — likely reselling them to someone else on a third party site.	comment link	archive link

#10120	23-Jul-25	Reddit	amdinizo	300,000	This actually happened to me too. Some dipshit used like 300k miles to book an economy ticket from India to Canada on Qatar (lols). Luckily I caught it like a day after the booking and changed everything. I think Alaska was part of the data breach that happened a few months ago. Yea they were more concerned about having me talk to their privacy team to protect others vs anything else. They were actually very understanding with me too. This isn’t actually an LOL. So they only took 300k of my miles but I did some re-jigging with trips after since I already hit 75k. Take all trips away I have over 600k miles. Played correctly that’s like $80-100k in value. I actually was able to get the person who stole my miles name and personal information. I tried to add them on IG and LinkedIn (was not successful).

#10125	25-Jul-25	YouTube	centsorsense	285,000	my Alaska Air account might have been hacked or there’s some like super suspicious activity going on… I went on my phone to pull up my Miles account… like almost 300000 points gone… I’m like dude what the… like my points are just gone... they booked three separate 95000-point flights… I did not book any of these… so yeah this is like a massive fraud situation... I called Alaska… told them these were not my bookings they were like okay this is definitely fraud.	comment link	archive link
#10126	26-Jul-25	Reddit	Anxious-Astronomer68		I went into my Alaska app today to preorder food for an upcoming trip only to find that I had been logged out of my account. When I went to reset my password it told me that my email address was not recognized. I was able to reset my password using my mileage plan name and bday only to find someone had hacked my account changed the email and password and had booked themselves a flight using my miles from Newark to LA next week. I cancelled the fraudulent flight updated all of my passwords and reached out to customer care to see if I can add a pin or other 2 factor authentication. Looks like I’m not the only one either. This was reported earlier this week. My existing flights were paid with cash vs miles so I have to imagine that’s the only reason the hackers didn’t cancel them to free up more miles.	comment link	archive link
#10127	26-Jul-25	Reddit	Ok_Sir_7220		Happened to me a year ago. I now use a PIN each time I was never notified my information was changed.

#10129	29-Jul-25	Reddit	TryLearnGrow	190,000	I just noticed someone stealing 190K miles from my account. I called Alaska and they cancelled the flight but I still have to deal with their mileage plan team to request to get these reinstated. A simple 2FA code during redemption would be so much easier to implement! I really hope they implement MFA for login and redemption process rather than keeping our miles behind this inconvenient PIN process.	comment link	archive link
#10130	30-Jul-25	Reddit	mikefly562	30,000	I had 30000 miles that may have been hacked and the wait time on the phone are very long. I'll most likely just never fly alaska again. Their systems are obviously not secure.	comment link	archive link
#10131	30-Jul-25	Reddit	Glass-Bobcat4357		Vent on customer service. Logged into my account this morning to see it was hacked. Used the chat bot and reset the password and updated my info. When I logged on saw all my points were drained. Chat couldn’t help me so transferred me to someone else. Waited 30 minutes and said they couldn’t help and to call the 1800 number. Called the 1800 number - requested a callback which they said estimated time was 25 minutes. Hours later nothing. So I call again. Been on hold for more than an hour. I would be freaking out less if I wasn’t hacked and just needed some info. Frustrating.	comment link	archive link
#10133	31-Jul-25	KIRO 7 News	MC	150,000	Matt Cottingham found out months after his account had been broken into. He went to buy a flight and found it had been locked. After hours on customer service holds he says Alaska Airlines told him his miles had been stolen though they were refunded. The most frustrating part was they told me if it happens again there’s a chance I won’t get refunded and I’m like ‘Well how am I supposed to know if this happens? How do you guys inform your customers?’ The representative didn’t have an answer for him. That was one of several questions KIRO 7 sent to Alaska Airlines regarding these apparent hacks. None of the calls and emails were answered. In Cottingham’s case his 150000 miles was worth around $1950 according to a NerdWallet estimate.	comment link	archive link

There are no trips booked in my account but I added MFA on my account a while back when I heard about this. Has anyone been successful in getting their miles back? I don’t know if the flights were flown or not because I can’t see it in my account but it just happened a few hours ago and we are traveling overseas so I wasn’t checking my notifications.	comment link	archive link
#10135	1-Aug-25	Facebook	LJ		mine was for what appeared to be a respected researcher at a university in NYC for a JFK-HKG flight. I definitely considered contacting the person it appeared to be directly to let them know that whatever site / agent they were using is a thief or at least uses questionable / thieving sources. After learning that some of the shady third party agencies on GF sometimes give people award bookings I decided not to freak them out by 'accusing' them of participating in fraud. Now I'm stuck calling in for every award booking because AS hasn't managed to figure out MFA in 2025	comment link	archive link
#10136	1-Aug-25	Facebook	MS		Sorry this happened to you it’s happened to me and many others too and AS is great about reinstating miles. But they famously do not have 2FA/MFA maybe you’re thinking of a different account? They’re going to make you put a PIN number on your account to make redemptions it stinks.	comment link	archive link

#10138	1-Aug-25	Facebook	TJ		Happened to me as well - even with a random computer generated15 digit alpha numeric with symbols password. I feel like there's an exploitation in their website or rogue employee(s) selling info as it's highly unlikely anyone knew my password or personal information to book flights with my points. I didn't receive any emails of the points being debited or the flights being created - it's all pretty suspect in my opinion. The good news is that the points were reinstated in just a few days the bad news is that I have to call Alaska to book with my pin in the future. Good luck sorry that happened to you.	comment link	archive link

#10140	1-Aug-25	Reddit	sweetniblets	70,000	Mine was hacked as well (latter half of June). No email notifications to my legacy account email that the account email and phone number were changed two tickets redeemed at 35k miles for two different names just found out today. I did receive a whooole bunch of spam emails around that time and wonder if the hackers were trying to cover up any potential email notifications from Alaska that would've notified me of the account changes. I searched through my emails and didn't seem to get anything though which seems like a security failure on Alaska's side. Waiting on the refund of my points now after talking to CS. Added that pin to my account too...seems better than nothing.	comment link	archive link
#10141	1-Aug-25	Reddit	lighteningbeam		I had my points drained recently too. Felt kinda sucky.

#10142	1-Aug-25	Reddit	olmsted	300,000	Yeah I had 300k+ miles plus some wallet funds drained from my account for flights from Lagos to Cairo (and additional fraudulent charges on a linked CC!). I am glad I check the app very frequently. I was able to cancel the thieves' tickets and get everything back without Alaska stepping in but I still notified them of the problem. They suggested that I let them lock my account which would require me to call them every time I wanted to book award travel. The idea of waiting on hold to use my miles because they couldn't be bothered with 2FA was not appealing to me so I told them I'd just go with a very secure password. They warned me that they would not assist me again in recovering stolen miles if my information is somehow stolen again (which... they didn't help me in the first place! I got everything back myself. If anything me supplying the data point was helping them). Really my only souring experience with AS (aside from BofA fuckery on the CC side of things).	comment link	archive link

#10144	3-Aug-25	Reddit	Yuhreka		Chiming in to say the same thing just happened to me this morning. Someone had booked a flight to Hawaii using my Alaskan Airline miles. I only checked my Alaska Airline app because I got a TripIt notification that my trip had been successfully imported. Turns out another flight was booked using my Alaskan miles few weeks ago. I didn’t get any notice for that flight. And for some reason that mileage transaction doesn’t even show up under my Mileage Activity in Alaskan Air app. I’m also one of the ones who recently transferred a bunch of my AmEx miles to Alaskan Air. Can I ask which number you called to report the stolen miles? I trying to call Customer Care and it’s 2.5 hr wait. I also tried resetting my password and got a message saying something went wrong.  didn’t know about the grounding either. I’ve been on hold for about an hour. So I noticed that whoever used my miles to book the flight bought a ticket for me too. I’m guessing they were hoping to get an empty middle seat. I’m so tempted to just show up and sit next to them.	comment link	archive link

#10147	5-Aug-25	US Card Forum	bibibibi	260,000	One morning my Gmail account was hacked and I received a large number of spam subscription emails (around 400+ in three hours). So I locked all my credit cards and started changing passwords for various accounts. A few days later when I logged into my AS account I found I had minus 260000 miles. On the day of the hack a ticket for ATQ-YYZ had been booked and had already flown away. When I checked my Gmail I found that an Alaska Revenue Protection email had been buried in my spam folder. Please call Customer Care at 1-800-654-5669 to verify your Mileage Account. There has been recent activity from your account that we suspect may have been done without your permission. Calling customer service they readily refunded my miles. The downside is that after adding a PIN to my account I have to call customer service and use the PIN to redeem tickets when trying to claim them. Another rant about AS's terrible IT - can't they just make a phone call when there's fraudulent activivity.	comment link	archive link
#10148	6-Aug-25	LinkedIn	AB	185,000	Someone stole 185K miles from my Alaska Mileage account. I happen to log in to my Alaska Mileage Account and noticed a sharp decline in my available miles. Turns out someone just today redeemed 185K miles from my account for biz class tickets: Doha to London. It wasn’t me. No idea how they were able to do this and neither does Alaska. But big shout to Alaska Airlines customer service team! They were able to credit back the miles within 40 mins.  Going forward I do have to call their customer service and give a pin to book award tickets but it’s worth it for the peace of my mind. PSA: to my friends and network please check your loyalty program mileage balance. Fraudsters are going after them. Alaska told me this is happening quite a bit recently. Stay vigilant! 	comment link	archive link

On August 12th an Indian customer bought a QR HYD-ATL business class ticket (190k miles). Strangely I didn't receive any confirmation email. I guess they chose not to send me an email at checkout and paid the taxes with their own card. I called customer service uploaded my driver's license and set up a PIN number.

#10186	11-Sep-25	Reddit	Low_Somewhere_978	30,000	beware of fraud from possible Atmos Rewards website. I just wanted to share that I just experienced fraud on my account. Someone hacked into my account changed the email address and then booked two award tickets and used 30000 points to book these fraudulent tickets. I only noticed because I got a notification on my app and I was still logged in and the trip showed up under my trips and then I panicked! So one of the agents told me that ever since they launched the new Atmos rewards program they have been seeing a lot of fraud. I changed all my passwords and had to verify my identity with the fraud department and everything got straightened out (the tickets were canceled and I got my points back thank goodness) but then I went to log into the rewards account and sign in with my new password using Safari and the warning came up that said This Connection Is Not Private This website may be impersonating www.atmosrewards.com to steal your personal or financial information. You should go back to the previous page. This never showed up when I accessed the site on my iPhone OR on Google Chrome!!! I also downloaded the new Atmos Rewards app so now I'm scared it will happen again. I'm deleting it. I highly suggest everyone stop using that until they fix their security issues. same they told me that I would have to contact them if I want to book an award ticket too but maybe when 2FA comes into play they will change that. They told me it won't happen until the integration is complete with Hawaiian mileage plan which I think is October 1. 	comment link	archive link

Please call Guest Care at 1-800-654-5669 to add an Atmos Rewards number to your account before you continue. So that was stripped from my account but points were redeemed as well but not all of the points just enough for a nice Intl flight from JFK to KIX twice. Apparently this happened a week ago. I'm just putting a data point out there it could be a glitch it could be malicious but you may want to check your accounts.

I got the miles back but then when I tried to use them I had to call and was on the phone for almost 2 hours until someone could unlock my account. I told them to keep it unlocked since I didn’t care if the points were stolen again because I’m NEVER flying Alaska again.

#10197	25-Sep-25	FlyerTalk	FragranceMarketingGuy	215,000	Hacked As Well Looked at my Points Activity and noticed 2 Qatar 215000 tickets deducted. immediately called Customer Care and have to follow the Pin Restriction until Dual Authentication arrives (supposedly in a few weeks). Points immediately redeposited after I sent in my ID.	comment link	archive link
#10198	25-Sep-25	FlyerTalk	sbedelman		This is same experience I had. It was a hack. Multiple tickets issued for travelers originating in China. The first thing they did was change the email address on the account (no flag of this by Alaska) so the reservation confirmations went to them. I immediately called the airline. As with you the reservations remained on my account but clicking through gave the same error message and my miles were reinstated so what we experienced appears to be the standard procedure. It was just luck that I signed into my account that day.	comment link	archive link
#10199	28-Sep-25	Reddit	Margaritasinthesun	350,000	350000 miles stolen!!! On Sept 9th 350000 miles were stolen out of my account. Two tickets flown SFO-TPE with the flyers names on them showing in my app. Email on the account was changed. Called customer service who requested my license via email. Waiting on response. Outrageous that I never received an email notification that my email was changed nor is there a 2fa option on the account. How long do I have to wait to get my miles back??? Are they going to do anything to the people who flew the ticket??? Just got off the phone with AS rep after waiting 2 hours for a callback! All the miles were returned to my account today with the caveat that the account is on permanent lock unless I call in with my pin to book. I’ll take what I can get at this point.	comment link	archive link
#10200	28-Sep-25	Reddit	cowlton		I had this happen with alot less points though. They booked a flight same day but I was able to cancel it before flight. Alaska replaced miles no problem and put a lock of my miles with a pin which is a real pain in the ass because I wanted to use them recently and had to wait for rewards to open the next day and my flight increased quite a bit. How they dont have 2 factor authentication is beyond me	comment link	archive link

#10202	29-Sep-25	Reddit	Difficult_Rhubarb174	70,000	This happened to me a few months ago. They will get the miles back to you. Mine came back in a few days. I’d bet you didn’t get an email because they also changed your primary email to theirs. You now get to join the fun club where you have to call to get your miles unlocked so you can use them. I’d rather be slightly inconvenienced and not lose 70000 miles again.	comment link	archive link

#10204	29-Sep-25	Reddit	wannabebondgirl007		They’ll fix it and I got my miles back immediately but unfortunately it comes with a forever headache. Your account will be forever locked. Whenever you want to book mileage you’ll have to call and unlock your account. Of course it’s great to be protected but the customer care office is not open every day and closes at a certain time. Whenever I tend to have a chance to sit down and look at reward travel it tends to be at night after work which is when they’re closed.it’s been a year now since my account was compromised	comment link	archive link
#10205	29-Sep-25	Twitter	PR	750,000	I had Hawaiins mileage acct for a very long time no issues. Since 'Atmos' came along I have been hacked twice for 750 thousand miles now to use my points I have to call in (not on Sunday) they will unlock my acct for one hour so I can book flights then they lock it again. I am not the only one. Be warned Alaska Mileage is ripe for hacking. Watch for flights booked on Qatar and Japan Airlines for international travel. Read about this and check your Atmos account DAILY!

#10207	30-Sep-25	Reddit	Jwfriar		I had the same thing happen to me but before the flights were flown. I was also freaking out but managed to get the miles back. Alaska’s fraud detection system is WOEFULLY terrible. Someone booked a flight between 2 cities I’d never flown in F that I never fly with a name I’ve never used using all of my miles on a partner airline. Each of those individually should trigger a 2 factor authentication or fraud screen. It’s insane they let that get booked. I don’t know if them having flown the flight it’ll be as easy for you. Hopefully you’ll get them back They also added a pin for any future use of miles	comment link	archive link
#10208	30-Sep-25	Reddit	Loving-my-Pyr	50,000	Yes you will get them back. Three years ago I had 50K stolen and the thief used my airlines credit card too. Everything was refunded in less than 24 hours. Now I get a text every time my CC is used. And there is a block on my acct to use miles. I have to call them and they unblock it for one hour. This works VERY WELL.	comment link	archive link

#10210	11-Oct-25	Reddit	zoenberger		Was your account hacked? Happened to me. The person got in changed my email and phone number and then bought a ticket. I couldn't login and when I tried to reset the password on the web I'm assuming the reset emails were going to the other email on the account. I got lucky and the mobile app still had an active login session so I was able to figure out what was going on. I changed my email back and reset the password. Better call Alaska and find out if miles are missing also.	comment link	archive link

#10215	27-Oct-25	Reddit	Calm-Refrigerator910	50,000	This happened to me this AM! Got an email Sunday that somone redeemed 50k miles. I contacted them via chat and they said closed on Sundays call Monday. I did at 7 AM PST right when the open and thank god I did because the fight was for this morning. She said they cancelled the ticket and put a no go status on it if they show up and try and fly. At least they sent the email otherwise I would have never known! The crazy thing is to unlock my account now they want me to email a copy of my drivers license. I had to educate them that this is EXACTLY why fraud is so rampant what if they have my email password (now or at any point in the future) and now the scammer has a copy of my Drivers license? I don't think so. You'd think these mega companies would have a way or you to upload or send securely?	comment link	archive link

No loyalty and no service.	comment link	archive link
#10217	29-Oct-25	Reddit	Curious_Gas_2608		Need to call them (Alaska) back ASAP. They are able to cancel that ticket and refund the miles - but very important to do it before the scammer flies. This happened to me a couple years ago and they took care of it all over the phone. If the first rep can't help you ask to speak to a supervisor.	comment link	archive link
#10218	29-Oct-25	Reddit	mtcizzle		My friend had the same thing happen last week. She called CS they refunded her miles and now she needs to call CS to authenticate before any purchase with her miles.

#10220	29-Oct-25	Reddit	blazerlazer18		Police report won’t do anything. Contact Alaska and get your miles back or money and then they will lock your account so if someone gets access to it they won’t be able to use the miles. It is because the lack of 2 factor authentication that it is easy for people to get into accounts. Happened to me before.	comment link	archive link
#10221	30-Oct-25	Reddit	ivorytowerescapee	100,000	This has happened to me too - about 100k miles stolen and used to book an adult only resort in Spain. The main Alaska line said the only way was to let it go and they'd refund the miles just this once but their hotels customer service cancelled the reservation. I spent at least an hour+ on the phone I was pissed. My password is very strong now.	comment link	archive link
#10222	30-Oct-25	Reddit	Prize_Emergency_5074		Shouldn’t be so easy to change key info on accounts like. They changed my phone # and email address with the same ease as I did changing them back. Somehow I was still able to access my account thru the app and make the changes. Big holes in security here. Just got off the phone with CS and said the same. The solution is to add a PIN code to my account which would require me to call in anytime I wanted to access the site. I said no thanks I’ll take my chances with my new password rather than have to go through all that. Yeah screw that pin bs. That’s too much work just to access your account. I hope everything got straightened out for you. Took 2 1/2hrs but AR made things right.	comment link	archive link
#10223	30-Oct-25	Reddit	Away_Association_636		Yep same thing happened to me a week ago. I just randomly check my account sometimes to make sure my credit card points/miles are transferring over. Just so happened to check it late Thursday night and found three tickets were purchased with my points and were scheduled to leave an hour later from Dubai! I was fortunately able to cancel the tickets in time and got my points back. They had changed my email too but left my phone number and I had not received any texts or push notifications about this flight which normally I do. Changed the email address back to my own changed my password and contacted Alaska. Was told the only thing they could do for me is to lock my account and I’d have to call and use a PIN anytime I wanted to book a flight using my points.	comment link	archive link

How does that even happen?? Couldn’t get through to customer care it was a 3+ hour hold time. Tried again this evening when I found the second hack and another person flying on my miles…30 minutes and waiting. Both flights were still in the air when I found out but there is absolutely no recourse to flag it quickly to get the perpetrators at their destinations. The web chat agent said they couldn’t help and to just wait in whatever length of queue there is. I’ve been loyal to Alaska for decades but this is really changing my mind	comment link	archive link
#10229	1-Nov-25	US Card Forum	ltty		Holy crap I just discovered my account was hacked. I just applied for Atoms and completed the sign-up requirements. My phone number and email address were completely changed without any warning. I only found out when I couldn't log in to book. I booked tickets for the next day and they flew yesterday. They issued seven tickets from PHX to SAN with seven Middle Eastern names all with the same last name. It's outrageous.	comment link	archive link
#10230	2-Nov-25	Reddit	CharChar7007		I’ve been reading through these discussions after staying up last night dealing with the same issue. It’s unbelievable that Alaska still doesn’t offer basic two-factor authentication — and even more concerning that they don’t send email notifications when account contact information is changed. This isn’t just about stolen miles or the countless hours many of us have spent trying to recover them. These accounts also contain highly sensitive personal data — in my case all my family’s travel information including passport numbers Global Entry details and birthdates. It’s unacceptable that such data isn’t better protected. I’ll be reaching out to Alaska today to let them know that unless they address these serious security gaps I won’t be using their services in the future. This level of oversight is simply unacceptable in today’s world.	comment link	archive link
#10231	2-Nov-25	Reddit	BeachView4		I woke up yesterday to an email from Alaska thanking me for redeeming points for flights. Overnight my account was hacked and three tickets were purchased. I immediately changed my password and called customer service. The flight booked was for later that day and I believe Alaska was able to cancel the reservations. I was told the points would be immediately put back into my account(hasn’t happened yet). I was also told my account would be locked. An email would be sent requesting a picture of the front of my drivers license and at that point my account would be unlocked. I just received the email but they are also asking me to create and include a PIN for my account which I will need in the future to redeem points. I’ve never had a company ask me to email them a PIN which doesn’t seem very secure. I have no problem emailing my DL but including a PIN seems weird. Has anyone else experienced this?	comment link	archive link

#10242	5-Nov-25	OneMileAtATime	Breanna		Nice that it was easy in this situation. For us normal people it has taken over a week multiple calls and placements on hold several communications with several AKAir reps who ALL neglected to remove the fraudulant email from my account leaving me remaining in a locked out stats multiple rude engagements with people who did not care to listen to the actual issue and stress and tears. Were the miles replaced eventually- yes. Did it compensate in ANY way for the treatment and endless circles endured. NO. This was truly one of the most unpleasant experiences I have had to deal with in a very long time and while the miles were returned I continued to be treated like *I* did something wrong- even through multiple representatives continued error. I was told you seem to have just gotten the short end of the stick and that is all I can say. *I* removed the fraudulent email from my account after 3.5 HOURS of going in circles today alone. What a joke. 	comment link	archive link

#10244	10-Nov-25	Reddit	0520BB	112,500	The exact same thing happened to me. Apparently on July 28th someone hacked my account. I know it's natural to assume I did something in some way to cause my account to be hacked but that's not the case. I only use my app when I need to book a flight or while I travel neither of which I had done since more than a month prior to that. I was not anywhere near my AA account in July or August. On 8/22 I got an email from Atmos explaining the switch and it said the login information is the same as whatever I used for Alaska Airlines. I tried to login and it said the password was incorrect. I tried to have the password reset and it told me an email was being sent to an email address (not fully shown just the first letter followed by a lot of asterisks and hotmail.com) that was not mine. I've only ever had the same gmail. I tried three times and it showed the wrong email each time. I honestly thought there was just an error on Atmos' end when they transferred our information into their system. cShe confirmed my account was hacked on 7/28 and that they took 112500 miles. Three flights were book on Starlux and the names are listed. They obviously changed the email address so I didn't recieve confirmation emails about the miles being used. I asked how they changed my email address on 7/28 to steal miles but Atmos had my correct email on 8/22 when they sent the reminder email and she didn't have an answer. She made me give her my real email address then she sent me an email and asked me to email her back a picture of my driver's license and a four digit pin of my choosing. Apparently this restricts my account now and I will forever have to call and give my pin if I want to book flights with my miles. I told her that it was disappointing to know that because they didn't have any sort of multi step verification process in place that I would forever be inconvenienced to have to call to book flights now. I actually brought up my husband's account and asked if we should put his in restricted status and give him a pin if that was the only way to ensure no one could just easily hack his account change his information and steal his miles. I basically got her to say that Atmos accounts are NOT safe right now because their is no multi step verification process before changing personal information or to use the miles. She said she understood my frustration and put me on hold (as if 3+ hours wasn't already enough) to go speak with her supervisor. She came back and told me that they are going to be coming out with a 3 step authentication process very soon so there is no need to put the pin restrictions on my husband's account. She told me that emails will go out notifying us at that time and when that happens I won't have to use the pin any longer. In the meantime the customer service rep is supposed to be opening a claim to get me my miles back. No time line was given. I sent my driver's license and pin via email and never received a response. I sent a follow up email a few days later asking for verification of receipt. I reminded her that since I was already hacked and feeling vulnerable asking me to email private information like a driver's license via email and not in a more secure fashion was making me nervous and really highlighting their lack of security. I still haven't gotten a response or gotten my miles back. We'll see. It's crazy to ask customers to spend hours and hours of their time just trying to get support. Sounds like Atmos needs more employees better management and much higher security levels! It might be time for me to step away from Alaska Airlines.	comment link	archive link
#10245	16-Nov-25	Facebook	PJ		Hello! I just had someone fraudulently book a trip through my Atmos account using my points on Iberia last night. Horrified I cancelled the trip and changed my account password. This caused my points to be credited back to me thankfully. I would like to turn on MFA but I don’t see that option. I chatted with reservations and let them know.  Has anyone else had this happen? Is there anything else I need to do? I have 90000 points which obviously are with a lot of money. Thanks!	comment link	archive link
#10246	16-Nov-25	Facebook	MJM	83,000	I had it happen and was notified by Alaska last week. I went from 180K+ points to 97K. I had to submit a bunch of stuff to identify myself and was told unless I set a pin I will not be credited if it happens a gain. Now I will be required to call and unlock my account before I can book award travel. That will be a royal pain but I don't want to risk loosing points again. I cannot change my password without calling. So the account is locked with the old password on it.	comment link	archive link

#10248	16-Nov-25	Facebook	TM		It happened to me too. Business class tickets to China. Luckily found it right after it happened. Immediately cancelled got points back and using Apple PW manager changed to theoretically uncrackable password. The problem with locking the account is that you have to call customer service and they aren’t available 24/7. Allegedly working on 2FA.	comment link	archive link
#10249	16-Nov-25	Facebook	JDF		Same thing happened to me in August. I only found it when I began an initial search for a spring trip to Honolulu. I noticed a huge amount of points missing. Then looked at my trips and found a trip taken throughout Colombia and another booked for the next day. I tried to cancel the flight but couldn’t. The name phone number email and even the date of birth had been changed in my account. I very frustrated called customer service. After a 3 hour wait I received a call back. What a hassle. Anyway that next day’s flight was canceled. I actually asked Alaska Air to have police meet the person at the airport but they wouldn’t. Customer service gave me back all of the used miles. The biggest hassle was getting account access returned to me. That took about 3 days. I had to provide my drivers license as well as speak with a few Alaska Air team members to verify I was me. Thank goodness I didn’t have my credit card number saved an only miles went missing. I have a pin on my account now and must call CS to book trips using mikes. I was very surprised such changes to my account could be made in the first place. Hackers are pretty savvy!	comment link	archive link

After the booking is done Alaska never notified me that my points have been deducted and a trip had been booked. All communication was sent to my friend’s email. Typically the airlines will send an email to the account owner when miles are being deducted from the account but nothing is sent from Alaska.	comment link	archive link

#10258	26-Nov-25	Seattle Times	user1112343	160,000	Three years ago 160000 miles were stolen from my Alaska Airline's mileage account. I noticed It about 2 hours before the flight was to depart Doha Qatar. I had the travelers name passport number etc. I called Alaska and alerted them but they would do nothing. I found the perp on instagram and saw pictures of him and his lady toasting their travels with champagne! Alaska did nothing but ask me to change my password and require that I call them to unlock my account whenever I want to use miles. The dept I have to call is only open 8-430 weekdays. So very inconvenient especially when traveling abroad. The login j used for Alaska is different than any login I use for anything else. They need to institute two-factor identification for login. It would solve the majority of these issues. I only got my miles back after I tagged @alaskaair on social media. They contacted me IMMEDIATELY after doing so.	comment link	archive link
#10260	27-Nov-25	Seattle Times	user1060599	150,000	Same story here. A couple of years ago I had 150K+ miles drained from my account. At the time a bad actor knowing only your Mileage Plan number could initiate a password change. The fraudster changed my password and the account email address then purchased flights for themselves. Alaska's 1990's-style IT security did not alert me to any of this I only found out when trying to log into my account weeks later. Virtually every other type of online account will sent an alert to the current email on file if basic account information is changed. And of course 2MFA has been around forever. But Alaska prefers to force its customers to lock down their account with a PIN only usable during certain hours when you need to book with miles. Alaska has told me that if I have this PIN lock removed I would be responsible for any future account fraud. They would rather put the burden of fraud management on their customers than implement common sense security measures in their systems. 	comment link	archive link
#10261	27-Nov-25	Seattle Times	Chaz12345		I had the same issue with Alaska. When I called customer service person told me it was partially my fault. How I have no idea. In addition a flight I had booked with miles for my daughter was cancelled (they were leary about fraud again) although she is listed as a traveler in my profile —they cancelled anyway and I had to rebook for additional miles. Took a few calls to get the extra miles required to rebook flight returned. Then shockingly someone accessed my account again. I don’t care about the miles as much as all the info in that account… passport info nexus card info… you name it. Alaska has a problem. They need to fix it. Class action lawsuit needed.	comment link	archive link
#10262	27-Nov-25	Seattle Times	CD	500,000	Alaska flyer since the Golden Samovar and gold bar giveaways days here. I recently had about 500000 miles stolen from my Atmos account I was alerted by an Alaskan email congratulating me for my upcoming trip. Like others I was on customer server phone for hours and finally found a chat bot that referred my to a fraud unit. I sent them the requested material and got a case number and have not heard back in weeks. Alaska: This is Reference#: 11XXX439 please call me or email at the numbers and address I sent you and let us get to the next steps. You should easily be able to find the stolen tickets cancel them and refund my mileage.  ALSO I agree with others that your IT is so busy keeping your flight systems running I would guess that they have little time for mileage fraud. SUGGESTION: Outsource your fraud hunting to the banking partner that issues your credit card they have fully staffed fraud units with the computer tools and expertise to quickly find the fraudsters responsible.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards customer since early 1980.	comment link	archive link
#10263	27-Nov-25	Seattle Times	BlueLakeDawg		Time for a two factor authentication Alaska? My miles disappear and you will have to reimburse me. Should all be treated like real money.	comment link	archive link
#10259	27-Nov-25	Twitter	NettePot	50,000	Watch your emails if you have AlaskaAir points!! 50k points redeemed by a scammer and customer service is off for thanksgiving. Congrats to whomever got a free flight on me!	comment link	archive link
#10264	28-Nov-25	Facebook	HM		This also happened to me last week. I made the mistake of logging out of my app thinking it was a glitch and then was locked out entirely and couldn’t change my password. I had to call Alaska. They fixed it and refunded my points but they told me that if it happens again they will not refund a second time. They don’t have MFA and they don’t allow special characters in passwords. It’s like they are begging for more fraud. Super sketch!	comment link	archive link
#10265	28-Nov-25	Reddit	BiggusDickusRoman		This happened to me over the summer as well. When I called to report it Alaska acted like they were doing me a favor by crediting the miles and telling me I’d now have to call a human with my PIN for any future redemptions. It would be so simple to modernize with 2FA but if it costs them a penny they just won’t do it.	comment link	archive link
